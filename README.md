# Fort Assault Robbery for VORP Framework - Red Dead Redemption 2

Fort Assault Robbery is a script for the VORP Framework in Red Dead Redemption 2 that introduces a dynamic fort assault robbery scenario. Using a "presidential order" item, players can initiate an assault on a fort. The script then spawns NPC defenders who guard the fort. Players have to survive the onslaught for a specific duration to earn a reward in the form of in-game currency.

## Prerequisites

- The VORP Core Framework
- The VORP Inventory System

## Installation

1. Download the source code and extract the files to a new folder named `thc-fortassault`.
2. Add `thc-fortassault` to your server resources directory.
3. Include `start thc-fortassault` in your server.cfg file.
4. Restart your server.

## Configuration

You can find the configuration file at `config.lua`. Here, you can adjust the settings for the Fort assault event, such as NPC spawn locations, assault duration, and the size of the event zone.

## Usage

Players need the "presidential order" item to start the fort assault event. Once the player is within the specified area and has the required item, they can trigger the event.
